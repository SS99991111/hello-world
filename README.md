Hello World exercise to get started with GitHub

Hello! My name is Ion.
At the time I am writing this I am a 25 years old university student learning Architectural Technologies and Construction Management in Denmark. 
Architecture intersects with the world of progaming in the field of Computational Design. Coding skills complements well my curent study focus, but is also a valuable asset in of itself.

I'm bullish on IT skills. I think they will become increasingly more usefull in the future as our civilization evolves. Committed to learn more.
